## Hello! I'm Brihadeesh, Thanks for Stopping By!
I'm an upcoming sophomore at [MSRIT](http://msrit.edu) in Bangalore, India. I'm Currently Pursuing a B.E Degree in Information Science and Engineering.

For the Past Year, I've been Chosen for the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador Program and also for the Student Developer Program by GitHub Education. I'm a Computer-Science Enthusiast with a knack for learning more and more. I am also a Full-Stack .NET and JavaScript Developer with Experience in Back End Technologies such as, MySQL and Heroku. I'm also interested in everything involving Python and Machine-Learning and hope to finish a certification course on it by the time I finish my Graduation.

I'm also a Core Developer at the Microsoft Student Community at MSRIT. We Organise Workshops, Hackathons and Projects for Students. We try to cover almost all the concepts you'd need to know to develop a project on your own. I Specialize in C# and am Interested in Hybrid Application Development, and also much more! I also maintain a blog, powered by ghost, to keep all those important midnight thoughts logged in, over [here](https://briha.live)
